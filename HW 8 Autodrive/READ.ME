HW 8 Autodrive
Team: Eric Wu, Michael Carnavos
In this project, we built a robot car that drives between two lines using image processing. The Image Processing was performed by an OpenMV camera, which uses UART protocol to communicate with a pyboard; the pyboard then uses a motor controller to drive the two motors at corresponding speeds, and thus keeping the robot within the two lines.
